# Lab 1 Report

To begin logging into a course-specific account on ieng6, you must follow these steps.

## 1. Installing Visual Studio Code

* Install Visual Studio Code by clicking this link to [VisualStudioCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and following the instructions to download and install onto your system.
* However, since I already had Visual Studio Code installed on my system, I was able to skip this step.
* Once installed, open the application and you should have a window similar to the image below. ![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122515834/212444711-a063c917-d04c-4474-8c6d-d4582d8d6b56.png)

## 2. Remotely Connecting

* Before connecting remotely to the server, we must reset our course-specific password 
* First click this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and enter your UCSD username + PID, and then press submit. 
* It will then show an account name, click the account name and you will be able to see a blue reset password hyperlink.
